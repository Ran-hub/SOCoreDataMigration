# SOCoreDataMigration

Recently, when I was working on a project at Space-O Technologies, I encountered a really annoying problem. When I modified the data model, the app started crashing. 

After getting number of panic attacks, I finally found the solution. What I needed to do is, to create a new persistent store for the modified data model. Now the app again runs efficiently.

Therefore, I thought I would share one demo of creating new persistent store to deal with this problem. Iâ€™ve also written an article on How to Minimize Crash-On-Launch Risk By Core Data Migration in iOS App that can help you implement it in your iOS app.

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your iOS app and looking to hire [iPhone app developer](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/hire-iphone-developer/)
to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
